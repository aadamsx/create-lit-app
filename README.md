Create-lit-app is something I put together after struggling to set up an app for a hobby project. Clone/fork this repo if you want to get started quickly building a fullstack LitHTML app with:

* Routing
* Express api
* Redux
* Build with webpack


Do you want to use webpack for building instead? Check out [this branch](https://github.com/thepassle/create-lit-app/tree/master)
